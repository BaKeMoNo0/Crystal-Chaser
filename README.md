## Introduction
Welcome to the Crystal Chaser project! This document provides an overview of the game concept, as well as current and planned features.

## Concept
Crystal Chaser is an arcade-style game where you control a character that moves horizontally across the screen. When reaching the left or right edge, the character seamlessly teleports to the opposite side, creating a continuous movement loop.

Crystals fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds, and your objective is to catch them before they hit the ground. Each crystal collected earns you points. Additionally, special objects will occasionally drop, granting bonuses or penalties that affect gameplay.

As the game progresses, the speed and frequency of falling objects increase, testing your reflexes and precision in an ever-intensifying challenge.

## Current Features

3. **Map :**
   - The game is set in a cave, designed using rock assets to create a natural and immersive environment.

4. **Scoring :**
   - Players earn points for each object successfully caught.
   - A rarity system has been implemented, featuring four types of crystals: blue, red, green, and white. Each crystal has a different spawn probability, with rarer crystals granting higher point values.
